# MedScan Insight - A web application to detect the disease

MedScan Insight is a web application designed to predict the diseases with the user's symptoms. It utilized machine learning to predict the diseases and build upon the Flask framework. The dataset to train and test was obtained from the Kaggle dataset [Predict Disease Symptom](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikudyawar/disease-symptom-prediction).

The project aims to allow users to diagnose illnesses from home, which is particularly beneficial during times such as the COVID-19 pandemic when visiting clinics may not be feasible. Users can input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses, empowering them to take charge of their health.

The application is a web-based platform built using the Flask framework. The required libraries for the project can be found in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Kolinhtetwin/MedScan-Insight/blob/f95cb750e32da3293f39d5bd5dd19fbba5de06d1/requirements.txt).
